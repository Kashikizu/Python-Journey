# # Functions:
name = input()
print("Hello", name) # A function takes the argument INSIDE
# # # Functions return something. So, you need to use variable = function(variable) to change it


# # Methods:
name.upper() # A method is used AFTER a variable
# # # Methods don't return anything. So, you just need to variable.method() to change it
